# Youtube-Playlist-Timer-Extension
 A small javascript extension that show the time needed to watch the whole playlist you are on (in x1).

You just have to clone the repo and put the extension on your browser (tested only on chrome).
Then go to a youtube playlist (for example https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYH8WvNV1YElPneq3cmmexAdmQf2pnICT).
And at the left just under the thumbnail the timer will be shown.

If the timer isn't shown make a issue and try to refresh the webpage.
